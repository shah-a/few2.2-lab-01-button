# FEW 2.2 Lab 1

Imagine this is an interview question. 

Using the markup below create the button in the picture.

```HTML
<button class="next-button">Next</button>
```

![button](images/button.png)

Style the button using the markup above. You should only be adding CSS styles! 

The arrow image on the right side of the button should be added with the CSS background image property. Use the image below: 

<div style="background-color: black; margin: 1rem">
  <img src="images/circle-arrow.png">
</div>

Really there is an image above but it has a white background! You should be able to click and save it to your desktop!

You'll need to do the following: 

- Give the button some padding
  - You'll need padding all sides
  - Use more padding on the right to leave room for the image
- Remove the border
- Set the font-size and color
- Set the background image with the following properties: 
  - background-image
  - background-size
  - background-position
  - background-repeat
